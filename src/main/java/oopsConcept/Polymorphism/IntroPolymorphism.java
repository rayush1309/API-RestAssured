    * Polymorphism - poly +morphism --> same Name + Multiple form (Action/Behaviour)
    * Type :
    * 1. compile Time /early binding /Static Binding /Overloading
    *
    *
    * Overloading - Same Method Name and different Signature.
    *
    * 2. Run Time/late Binding/dynamic Binding / Overriding
    *
    * In overloading --> all Methods should be in same class itself
    *
    * Question : can we achieve Method Overloading by keeping Method Signature Same and changing Return Type ?
    * Ans:- NO - compile time error - duplicate method name
    *
    * Abiguity if we ahve byte and int and double data type
    *
    * Question : can we overload Main Method?
    * yes: But Argument should be different : else JVM will confuse from where I should Start to execute the program
    *
